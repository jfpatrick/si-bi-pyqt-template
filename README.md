# BE-BI Application Frame

This is the repository for the BE-BI Base Application Frame code.


It can be used tTo bootstrap a PyQt GUI project: the code provides a basic 
architecture that you only have to extend with your own interface and logic. 

It provides:
- A sane folder structure for your code, based on the MVP architecture.
- A test setup ready for unit tests and GUI tests (based on `pytest-qt`)
- A minimal simulation environment for your tests (based on 
[`papc`](https://gitlab.cern.ch/pelson/papc)), 
that can be extended to mimick your real data sources (FESA, NXCALS, ...)
- A `setup.py` to customize for quick packaging & release, with `entry_points`
- `.gitignore` with common Python artifacts
- `.gitlab-ci.yml` supporting GUI testing out of the box and coverage reports
- A small `activate.sh` activation script to activate both your virtualenv and Acc-Py, and
sets up some env vars for QtDesigner

See below for a more detailed explanation of all the features.

## Getting started

#### Install
Assuming Python 3.6 is installed and `acc-pyqt` is active in your shell
([more info here](https://wikis.cern.ch/display/ACCPY/PyQt+distribution)), type:
```
git clone https://:@gitlab.cern.ch:8443/szanzott/be-bi-application-frame.git
cd be-bi-application-frame/
source /acc/local/share/python/acc-py-pyqt/setup.sh
acc-py venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .[all]
```

#### Start
The application can already be started. To start it, type:

```
empty-application-frame
```

You should see the frame with a dummy application in the center, like this:

![](images/application-frame.png)

Or a smaller window with an error. In the latter case, please report the error 
to the maintainers.

## Usage
This code base is meant to be used as a boilerplate to get you started on a new
PyQt GUI without too much overhead. Here is a description of what every file
does and when/how you are encouraged to modify it.

#### `.gitignore`
Typical .gitignore file that excludes most Python artifacts. You can add your
own files/folders to exclude them from version control.

#### `.gitlab-ci.yml`
This file configures GitLab CI to run your tests each time you push your code
to the repository.

It differs sensibly from the default obtained by executing 
`acc-py init ci`, because it has been configured to:

1. Run headless GUI tests with `pytest-qt`
2. Provide a coverage report you can use as a repository badge.
3. Do not deploy automatically on the CERN Python repository 

You can  modify it to add more tasks, deploy automatically, do linting,
or anything else.

#### `activate.sh`
Small bash script sourcing, in order, Acc-PyQt and your virtualenv (assuming 
it's called `venv` and lives in the current directory). It also sets the 
`PYQTDESIGNERPATH` in case you want to use QtDesigner with the 
[`accwidget`](https://gitlab.cern.ch/acc-co/accsoft/gui/accsoft-gui-pyqt-widgets)'s
plugin.

#### `README.md`
This README file. Please populate it meaningfully, including at the minimum some
information about what it it, how to execute it, who's the author/maintainer 
and any precautions to take when running/debugging (is this GUI operational?)

#### `setup.py`
This is the file that define your application as a Python package. You're 
strongly encourage to develop your projects as packages instead of simple
script, for easier maintainability and deployments.

The file contains comments on what you should change and what can be left as it 
is.

You can learn more about Python packaging in 
[here](https://packaging.python.org/).

#### `be_bi_application_frame/main.py`
Application's entry point. You can edit the main function to load your GUI, 
as specified in the comments of the file itself, but this file should contain 
no more than the small function that start the event loop. 
The rest of the logic will go in the other folders.

#### `be_bi_application_frame/widgets`
This contains the components of your application. In an MVP model, these are 
the Presenters: instantiate the Views (see `be_bi_application_frame/resources`)
and wire them to the Models (see `be_bi_application_frame/models`), 
acting as an intermediary when required.

In this specific case, the `ApplicationFrame` `QWidget` lives in there.

#### `be_bi_application_frame/resources`
This folder contains multiple entities, all related to the View from an 
MVP perspective. They are:

- `*.ui` files. These are generated by QtDesigner and are XML files describing 
your GUI's layout, with no logic.
- `ui_*.py` files. These files are generated by `pyuic5` basing on the `*.ui`
file with matching name. NEVER MODIFY THESE FILES: they contain generated
code and every modification will be erased at the next run of `pyuic5`.
- Static resources (PNG, GIF, etc...) with `*.qrc` files. These files are Qt's 
Resource files and are used to load static files, like images and icons, 
into the GUI.
- `*_rc.py` files. These are generated by `pyrcc5` basing on the `*.qrc` files
present in the `images` folder with a matching name. NEVER MODIFY THESE FILES: 
they contain generated code and every modification will be erased at the next
run of `pyrcc5`.

_More instruction on how to use pyuic5 and pyrcc5 coming soon_

In this folder, you should modify the `*.ui` and `*.qrc` files only with 
QtDesigner (unless you *really* know what you're doing) and load the Views 
into the Presenters (`/widgets/` folder) by importing the `ui_*.py` files.

#### `be_bi_application_frame/models`
This folder contains the Models of your application. In the dummy application,
the only Models required are the sources of data for the plots, but they
can be any object connecting to the control system, like PyJAPC instances, 
NXCALS connections, etc...

Models should send their data to the Views by emitting Signals that match
corresponding Slots in the View or Presenter.

#### `be_bi_application_frame/models/papc_setup`
This folder contains a barebone papc setup to sandbox your application. papc
is a library that can trick you application into believing it's connecting to
the control system, while it's receiving simulated data instead.

papc is also an interesting option for meaningful and through GUI tests. Read
more about it on the 
[Acc-Py wikis](https://wikis.cern.ch/display/ACCPY/papc+-+a+pure+Python+PyJapc+offline+simulator).

#### `be_bi_application_frame/tests`
This folder contains the automated tests for your app. It already contains some
basic tests to ensure your setup is correct, and they will be run on GitLab CI
every time you push code to your repository. 

You can run your tests locally by executing
```
python -m pytest
```

To see the coverage report, type:
```
python -m pytest --cov=be-bi-application-frame
```

If the tests hang, probably Qt is swallowing errors without exiting. Note that
this can happen for the same reasons on GitLab CI. To see the stacktrace,
re-run the tests as:
```
python -m pytest --vv --log-cli-level=DEBUG
```

This project comes with papc already configured to simulate a dummy device (see 
`be_bi_application_frame/models/papc_setup`). Please replace with a meaningful 
description of your own datasources (see the
[Acc-Py wikis](https://wikis.cern.ch/display/ACCPY/papc+-+a+pure+Python+PyJapc+offline+simulator)).

        This is the main class defining your GUI. In an MVP perspective,
        this is a Presenter, so a component acting as a proxy between Model
        and View.

        The Model will connect to the control systems or any other source of data.
        The View is the code generated from your *.ui files.

        Signals and slots are usually connected in this class, in the init.
        The model will usually emit signal which are catch either directly
        by the View, or by this class, which translates them into operations
        on the View.

        In this example we are connecting the plots on the View with the DataSources
        classes defined in the model, and the SpinBoxes below the plots with the custom
        ExampleModel class, that performs PyJAPC SET operations.
